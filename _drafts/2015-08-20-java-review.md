<h2>EPI in Java</h2>

We have a draft version of EPI in Java ready!

EPI is a community book - it's quality as well as content
is a testament to the enthusiasm and involvement
of our readers.

In this spirit, we'd like to ask readers to help us by providing
feedback on 1-2 chapters.

By acting as a reviewer, you will get 
<ul>
<li>a chance to perfect your interviewing skills,
<li> an early look at the book, 
<li> our undying gratitude, and, 
<li> a free hardcopy of the book.
if you are one of the first 25 (TODO: number?) reviewers,  TODO: make it pop, bold/red
</ul>

If you are interested, please sign up here (TODO).
Each issue you identify should be reported through a Google form, which you
can view here (TODO).

We expect reviewers to spend one to two afternoons going through
the chapter, and identify an issue per 1-2 pages. The text is 98\% the same
as for the current version - the big difference is in the programs. 

TODO: US only?
