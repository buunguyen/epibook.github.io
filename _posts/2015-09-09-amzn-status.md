<strike><h3>EPI is not currently available from Amazon, we are working on this issue</h3></strike>

<font color="red"><b>As of 12:43 CDT 9/15/2015, EPI is available again!</b></font>

<!-- For unknown reasons, EPI was not available from Amazon directly for over a week.
We made numerous calls to Amazon and Createspace (the publisher), but were never able to get a clear idea of what happened. -->
