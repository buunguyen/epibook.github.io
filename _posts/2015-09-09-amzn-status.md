<h3>EPI is not currently available from Amazon, we are working on this issue</h3>

For unknown reasons, EPI is not available from Amazon directly (it is available from resellers, but that can be a hit-or-miss).

We have made numerous calls to Amazon and Createspace (the publisher), but have not been able to resolve the issue (or even figure out
why it is not showing). We are continuing to work on this, hope to resolve it very soon.
