<b>The Java version of EPI is <strike>in press</strike> ready!</b>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/epi-java-thumbnail.png"></img>

<strike>It should be available from Amazon in a few days.
We will post a direct link to the Amazon page when it is ready.</strike>

<b>It's here!</b><p>

for EPI in Java.

The only difference between the original EPI and EPI in Java is that
the programs are now in Java instead of C++. (We also have a short chapter
on Java, which includes best coding practices for an interview and a small
number of language review questions; this replaces the similar chapter on C++
in the original EPI.)

All programs, Java and C++, are always available from the website.

We will continue to sell the original EPI for readers who prefer C++.
