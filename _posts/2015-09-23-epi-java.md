<b>The Java version of EPI is in press!</b>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/epi-java.png"></img>

It should be available from Amazon in a few days.
We will post a direct link to the Amazon page when it is ready.

The only difference between the original EPI and EPI in Java is that
the programs are now in Java instead of C++. (We also have a short chapter
on Java, which includes best coding practices for an interview and a small
number of language review questions; this replaces the similar chapter on C++
in the original EPI.)

All programs, Java and C++, are always available from the website.

We will continue to sell the original EPI for readers who prefer C++.
